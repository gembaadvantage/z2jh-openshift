# This config file is useful in the upgrade tests, where we upgrade from
# either the latest stable chart or the latest dev release of the chart. This
# config is only applied to the chart we upgrade to. It helps us handle
# situations when we add new configuration options that would fail with a schema
# validation error in the previous chart versions.
#
# Note that one could think that it would be possible to have dev-config.yaml
# include this config and then pass --set hub.some-option=null to null it out
# when it must not be passed, but that still triggers schema validation errors.
